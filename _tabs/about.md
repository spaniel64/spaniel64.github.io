# About me
Hi, I'm Dan. Here are a few things about me:
- I'm currently a Techanical Consultant at a local MSP in my home state of Tasmania, Australia.
- I spend some of my free time learning ethical hacking and pentesting.
- I love spending time with my beautiful daughter and partner (and our two cats 🐈).
