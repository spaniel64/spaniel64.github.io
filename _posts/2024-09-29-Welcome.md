# Welcome!
I'm Dan. Nice to meet you. 

This is a blog I've set up to post about my adventures in the world of technology.

I'm a Technical Consultant for a local MSP by trade, but I'm dipping my toes into the world of ethical hacking.

I've recently completed the Practical Ethical Hacking course offered by TCM Security. I highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to get a jump start further into the pentesting and ethical hacking field. Thank you to Heath Adams and the TCM team for providing this awesome course. If you're interested, you can check it out [here](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course).

In recent times, I've spent quite a bit of time with machines on HackTheBox. This will probably be the focus of the next few blog posts on here.
